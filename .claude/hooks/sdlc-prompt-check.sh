# Token-bloat fix: BASELINE block fires once per CC session (~250 tok × 50
# prompts = ~12K wasted tokens before this gate). Once Claude has the SDLC
# skill auto-invoked (covers TodoWrite/confidence/workflow), this static
# block is duplicate context. Sentinel is per-session_id so a fresh CC
# session re-emits the cold-start nudge. Without session_id (legacy CC, or
# direct shell tests with no JSON stdin), behavior is unchanged — emits
# every fire. SETUP-not-complete + EFFORT-bump branches above are NOT
# gated; they're dynamic state warnings that must fire every prompt.
#
# Concurrency: claim is atomic via `set -C` (noclobber) — the redirect
# `: > "$path"` create-or-fails. Across N parallel fires with the same
# session_id, exactly one wins the claim and emits BASELINE; the rest
# see file-exists and suppress. (Codex round 1 P1: previous "check then
# write after emit" pattern allowed N parallel fires to all emit.)

SDLC BASELINE:
1. TodoWrite FIRST (plan tasks before coding)
2. STATE CONFIDENCE: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
3. LOW confidence or FAILED 2x? Ladder: Fable -> Codex xhigh -> human LAST
4. Never ask what a model can settle; confidence is not authorization
5. ALL TESTS MUST PASS BEFORE COMMIT - NO EXCEPTIONS

AUTO-INVOKE SKILL (Claude MUST do this FIRST):
- implement/fix/refactor/feature/bug/build/test/TDD/release/publish/deploy → Invoke: Skill tool, skill="sdlc"
- DON'T invoke for: questions, explanations, reading/exploring code, simple queries
- DON'T wait for user to type /sdlc - AUTO-INVOKE based on task type

Workflow phases:
1. Plan Mode (research) → Present approach + confidence
2. Transition (update docs) → Request /compact
3. Implementation (TDD after compact)
4. SELF-REVIEW (/code-review) → BEFORE presenting to user

Quick refs: SDLC.md | TESTING.md | *_PLAN.md for feature
