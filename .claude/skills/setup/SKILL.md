# Setup Wizard - Confidence-Driven Project Configuration

## Task
$ARGUMENTS

## Purpose

You are a confidence-driven setup wizard. Your job is to scan the project, infer as much as possible, and only ask the user about what you can't figure out. The number of questions is DYNAMIC — it depends on how much you can detect. Stop asking when all configuration data points are resolved (detected, confirmed, or answered).

**DO NOT ask a fixed list of questions. DO NOT ask what you already know.**

## MANDATORY FIRST ACTION: Read the Wizard Doc

**Before doing ANYTHING else**, use the Read tool to read the ENTIRE `CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md` file. This file contains all templates, examples, and instructions you need. You CANNOT do this setup correctly without reading it first. Do NOT rely on summaries or references — read the full file now.

After reading, use it as the source of truth for every step below.

## Execution Checklist

Follow these steps IN ORDER. Do not skip or combine steps.

### Step 1: Auto-Scan the Project

Scan the project root for:
- Package managers: package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pyproject.toml, Gemfile, build.gradle, pom.xml
- Source directories: src/, app/, lib/, server/, pkg/, cmd/
- Test directories: tests/, __tests__/, spec/, test files matching *_test.*, test_*.*
- Test frameworks: from config files (jest.config, vitest.config, pytest.ini, etc.)
- Lint/format tools: .eslintrc, biome.json, .prettierrc, rustfmt.toml, etc.
- CI/CD: .github/workflows/, .gitlab-ci.yml, Jenkinsfile
- Feature docs: *_PLAN.md, *_DOCS.md, *_SPEC.md, docs/
- Deployment: Dockerfile, vercel.json, fly.toml, netlify.toml, Procfile, k8s/
- Design system: tailwind.config.*, .storybook/, theme files, CSS custom properties
- Branding assets: BRANDING.md, brand/, logos/, style-guide.md, brand-voice.md, tone-of-voice.*
- Existing docs: README.md, CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, AGENTS.md (cross-tool agent-instructions standard, ROADMAP #205)
- Scripts in package.json (lint, test, build, typecheck, etc.)
- Database config files (prisma/, drizzle.config.*, knexfile.*, .env with DB_*)
- Cache config (redis.conf, .env with REDIS_*)
- Domain indicators (for domain-adaptive TESTING.md):
  - Firmware/Embedded: Makefile with flash/burn targets, .cfg device configs, /sys/ or /dev/tty references, .c/.h source, platformio.ini
  - Data Science: .ipynb notebooks, requirements.txt with pandas/sklearn/tensorflow/torch, data/ or datasets/ dir, models/ dir
  - CLI Tool: package.json with "bin" field (no React/Vue/Angular), bin/ dir, src/cli.*, no src/components/
  - Web/API: default — everything else (web frameworks, src/components/, Playwright/Cypress config)

### Step 2: Build Confidence Map

For each configuration data point, assign a confidence level based on scan results:

**Configuration Data Points:**

| Category | Data Point | How to Detect |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Structure | Source directory | Look for src/, app/, lib/, etc. |
| Structure | Test directory | Look for tests/, __tests__/, spec/ |
| Structure | Test framework | Config files (jest.config, vitest.config, pytest.ini) |
| Commands | Lint command | package.json scripts, Makefile, config files |
| Commands | Type-check command | tsconfig.json → tsc, mypy.ini → mypy |
| Commands | Run all tests | package.json "test" script, Makefile |
| Commands | Run single test file | Infer from framework (jest → jest path, pytest → pytest path) |
| Commands | Production build | package.json "build" script, Makefile |
| Commands | Deployment setup | Dockerfile, vercel.json, fly.toml, deploy scripts |
| Infra | Database(s) | prisma/, .env DB vars, docker-compose services |
| Infra | Caching layer | .env REDIS vars, docker-compose redis service |
| Infra | Test duration | Count test files, check CI run times if available |
| Preferences | Response detail level | Cannot detect — ALWAYS ASK |
| Preferences | Testing approach | Cannot detect intent from existing code — ALWAYS ASK |
| Preferences | Mocking philosophy | Cannot detect intent from existing code — ALWAYS ASK |
| Testing | Test types | What test files exist (*.test.*, *.spec.*, e2e/, integration/) |
| Coverage | Coverage config | nyc, c8, coverage.py config, CI coverage steps |
| CI | CI shepherd opt-in | Only if CI detected — ALWAYS ASK |
| Domain | Project domain | Auto-detect from domain indicators above (firmware/data-science/CLI/web). Web/API is the default fallback. One domain per project — dominant signal wins |

**Each data point has one of three states:**
- **RESOLVED (detected):** Found concrete evidence — config file, script, directory exists. No question needed, just confirm.
- **RESOLVED (inferred):** Found indirect evidence — naming patterns, related config. Present inference, let user confirm or correct.
- **UNRESOLVED:** No evidence found — must ask user directly.

**Preference data points** (response detail, testing approach, mocking philosophy, CI shepherd) are ALWAYS UNRESOLVED regardless of what code patterns exist. Current code patterns show what IS, not what the user WANTS going forward.

### Step 3: Present Findings and Fill Gaps

Present ALL detected values organized by state to the user.

**For RESOLVED (detected) items:** Show what was found, let user bulk-confirm with a single "Looks good" or override specific items.

**For RESOLVED (inferred) items:** Show what was inferred with reasoning, ask user to confirm or correct.

**For UNRESOLVED items:** Ask the user directly — these are your questions.

**The ready rule:** You are ready to generate files when ALL data points are resolved (detected, inferred+confirmed, or answered by user). The number of questions you ask depends entirely on how many data points remain unresolved after scanning. A well-configured project might need 3-4 questions (just preferences). A bare repo might need 10+. There is no fixed count.

DO NOT proceed to file generation until all data points are resolved.

### Step 4: Generate CLAUDE.md

Using detected + confirmed values, generate `CLAUDE.md` with:
- Project overview (from scan results)
- Commands table (detected/confirmed commands)
- Code style section (from detected linters/formatters)
- Architecture summary (from scan)
- Special notes (infra, deployment)

Reference: See "Step 8" in `CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md` for the full template.

### Step 4.5: AGENTS.md Interop Detection (ROADMAP #205, phase a)

`AGENTS.md` is the cross-tool agent-instructions file converged on by Cursor, Continue.dev, Aider, and other agentic IDEs (CC issue #6235, 276 comments). If the user already has `AGENTS.md` in the repo, the wizard's `CLAUDE.md` overlaps in scope; ignoring it leads to drift between the two files.

**Detection** (already in Step 1's auto-scan): does `./AGENTS.md` exist?

**If YES, surface the dual-maintain decision:**

> Detected `AGENTS.md` (cross-tool agent-instructions standard, used by Cursor/Continue.dev/Aider). The wizard's `CLAUDE.md` covers the same ground for Claude Code. Three options:
>
> **A.** **Dual-maintain (recommended)**: keep both files. `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code (loaded into every session), `AGENTS.md` for other tools. Sync manually when changing one — phase (a) does not auto-merge. Future work (phase d) will add a drift-consistency test.
>
> **B.** **Merge** (manual in phase a): record your intent to converge on a single source of truth. The wizard does NOT copy content for you in v1.42.0 — phase (b) will add the copy/symlink helper. For now, pick this if you plan to merge by hand and just want the wizard to know.
>
> **C.** **Skip**: leave AGENTS.md alone. The wizard generates only `CLAUDE.md`. AGENTS.md will go stale relative to your CC-specific instructions.
>
> Pick A, B, or C: `[A/B/C]`

Default if no response: **A** (dual-maintain). Document the user's choice as a one-line comment in their project's `SDLC.md` (e.g. `<!-- AGENTS.md interop: dual-maintain (per ROADMAP #205 phase a) -->`). v1.42.0 does NOT teach `/claude-update-wizard` to parse this metadata key — that's phase (d) work. The comment is for reference and future `/claude-update-wizard` AGENTS-aware behavior.

**If NO `AGENTS.md` exists**: skip this step silently. Phase (b) of #205 (offer to ALSO generate AGENTS.md alongside CLAUDE.md) is deferred — not in v1.42.0 scope.

**Scope**: phase (a) only — detection + surfacing (v1.42.0). Phases (b) symlink-write, (c) partial (this step), (d) drift test are deferred.

### Step 5: Generate SDLC.md

Generate `SDLC.md` with the full SDLC checklist customized to the project:
- Plan mode guidance
- TDD workflow with project-specific commands
- Self-review steps
- CI feedback loop (if CI detected)
- Confidence levels

Include metadata comments:
```
<!-- SDLC Wizard Version: [version from CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md] -->
<!-- Setup Date: [today's date] -->
<!-- Completed Steps: step-0.1, step-0.2, step-1, step-2, step-3, step-4, step-5, step-6, step-7, step-8, step-9 -->
```

Reference: See "Step 9" in `CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md` for the full template.

### Step 6: Generate TESTING.md (Domain-Adaptive)

Generate `TESTING.md` using the domain-specific template matching the detected project domain:
- **Web/API (default)**: Standard Testing Diamond (E2E/Integration/Unit)
- **Firmware/Embedded**: HIL/SIL/Config Validation/Unit layers
- **Data Science**: Model Evaluation/Pipeline Integration/Data Validation/Unit layers
- **CLI Tool**: CLI Integration/Behavior/Unit layers

Each domain template includes:
- Domain-appropriate testing layer visualization and percentages
- Domain-specific mocking rules (what to mock, what NEVER to mock)
- Test commands and fixture locations
- Domain-specific sections (Device Matrix for firmware, Test Datasets for data science, Behavior Contract for CLI)

Reference: See "Step 9" in `CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md` for the full domain-conditional templates.

### Step 7: Generate ARCHITECTURE.md

Generate `ARCHITECTURE.md` with:
- System overview diagram (from scan)
- Component descriptions
- Environments table (from detected deployment config)
- Deployment checklist
- Key technical decisions

Reference: See "Step 6" in `CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md` for the full template.

### Step 8: Generate DESIGN_SYSTEM.md (If UI Detected)

Only if design system artifacts were found in Step 1:
- Extract colors, fonts, spacing from config
- Document component patterns
- Reference design sources (Storybook, Figma, etc.)

Skip this step if no UI/design system detected.

### Step 8.5: Generate BRANDING.md (If Branding Detected)

Only if branding-related assets were found in Step 1 (brand/, logos/, style-guide.md, brand-voice.md, existing BRANDING.md, or UI/content-heavy project detected):
- Brand voice and tone guidelines
- Naming conventions (product names, feature names, terminology)
- Visual identity summary (logo usage, color palette references)
- Content style guide (if the project has user-facing copy)

Skip this step if no branding assets or UI/content patterns detected.

### Step 9: Configure Tool Permissions

Based on detected stack, suggest entries for `permissions.allow` in `.claude/settings.json`:
- Package manager commands (npm, pnpm, yarn, cargo, go, pip, etc.)
- Build/test commands
- CI tools (gh)

Write the shape as:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm:*)",
      "Bash(npx:*)",
      "Bash(git:*)",
      "Bash(gh:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Do NOT write the deprecated top-level `allowedTools` array** (issue #197). Claude Code treats the presence of `allowedTools` in project settings as "user has explicitly scoped tool permissions" and silently disables its auto-mode classifier — same failure family as the model pin in #198. `permissions.allow` is the supported successor and does not trip the auto-mode gate.

Present suggestions and let the user confirm.

### Step 9.5: Context Window + Mixed-Mode Configuration (Opt-In)

The CLI ships `cli/templates/settings.json` with **no** `model` or `env` pin, preserving Claude Code's model auto-selection. Users can opt into a pin during setup — see `AI_SETUP_LANES.md` (Setup A: Opus 5 + Fable, recommended if pinning; B: Sonnet 5 Simple/One-Off; C: OpusPlan Hybrid).

**Why this is opt-in (issue #198):** A top-level `"model"` in `settings.json` disables auto-mode for the session. Pinning is only worth it when you want consistent model behavior rather than per-turn auto-selection.

**Check for global `[1m]` model pin (#391):** Read `~/.claude/settings.json`. If `model` contains `[1m]`, warn: global pin forces 1M on every repo; headless surfaces bill against credits after June 15. Offer `[r] Remove / [k] Keep`. If `r`: delete the `model` key.

**Run the complexity heuristic first (roadmap #233):**

```bash
npx agentic-sdlc-wizard complexity .
```

The output is JSON: `{ tier: "simple" | "complex", score, signals }`. Use the result to suggest a default in the prompt below — do NOT override the user's choice. The heuristic flags any `.env` / `secrets/` / `credentials/` at any depth as a stakes signal that forces `complex` regardless of size.

**Ask the user exactly once in Step 9.5:**

> Detected repo complexity: **{tier}** ({score}, signals: {loc, tests, hooks, workflows, stakes-flag if any}).
>
> How do you want to configure the model for this repo?
>
> - **[N] No pin (default):** Auto-mode. CC picks model per turn. Simplest, no advisor.
> - **[o] Opus 5 + Fable** *(Setup A — recommended if you want a pin, trial as of 2026-07-24):* Pins `model: "opus"`, `advisorModel: "fable"`. Requires CC v2.1.219+. Anthropic's newest flagship — unreplicated by field data yet, accepted-risk adoption. Effort: `xhigh` (Anthropic's own recommendation for difficult/long-running work).
> - **[s] Sonnet 5 + Fable** *(Setup B — Simple/One-Off, lower cost):* Pins `model: "sonnet"`, `advisorModel: "fable"`. Native 1M context, no `[1m]` suffix needed. Effort: `medium`, escalate `high` → `xhigh` for hard tasks.
> - **[p] OpusPlan Hybrid** *(Setup C — cost-conscious, still want Opus reasoning):* Pins `model: "opusplan"`. Opus 5 plans (Shift+Tab), Sonnet 5 executes. Max-bundled. No API credit drain (#390).
>
> `[N/o/s/p]`

**If the user answers `N` (default):** Make no edits to `.claude/settings.json`. Auto-mode stays on. Done.

**If the user answers `o` (Opus 5 + Fable):** Edit `.claude/settings.json` and add:

```json
{
  "model": "opus",
  "advisorModel": "fable",
  "effortLevel": "xhigh"
}
```

Tell the user: "Opus 5 + Fable (Setup A, trial 2026-07-24). Effort `xhigh` — Anthropic's own pick for hard/long work. Needs CC v2.1.219+ (`! claude update`). Check shell rc for a stale `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` — it silently overrides this pin. No autocompact override: no Opus-5 proactive threshold is documented, so no percentage is supported (wizard doc → Autocompact Tuning)."

**If the user answers `s` (Sonnet 5 + Fable):** Edit `.claude/settings.json` and add:

```json
{
  "model": "sonnet",
  "advisorModel": "fable",
  "effortLevel": "medium",
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE": "75"
  }
}
```

Tell the user: "Sonnet 5 + Fable (Setup B) — lower-stakes/simpler work. Effort `medium`, escalate `/effort high`→`xhigh`. Needs CC v2.1.170+. The `75` override is **global to this file** — it hits every conversation and subagent here and does NOT turn off if you later switch the driver to Opus; remove it by hand if you repin."

**If the user answers `p` (opusplan):** Edit `.claude/settings.json` and add:

```json
{
  "model": "opusplan",
  "advisorModel": "fable"
}
```

Tell the user: "Opus 5 plans (Shift+Tab), Sonnet 5 executes — both Max-bundled, no API drain (Setup C). Set effort per-session via `/effort`, not a shell-rc env var. Pin `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL: \"claude-opus-4-8\"` if you want 4.8's field-proven planning instead of Opus 5's. Needs CC v2.1.170+."

Mention the escape hatch in all three cases:
- To opt out later: remove the `model` line (and optionally the `env`/`effortLevel` keys) from `.claude/settings.json`, or run `/model` and pick "Default (recommended)".
- To switch tiers later: edit `.claude/settings.json` and replace the `model` value, or re-run `/claude-setup-wizard` Step 9.5.
- To pin Opus 4.8 explicitly instead of Opus 5 (any lane), set `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL: "claude-opus-4-8"` or use the full model string `claude-opus-4-8` directly.

This is project-scoped and shared with the team via git.

**After writing project settings (for `[o]`, `[s]`, or `[p]`), ask once:**

> Also set `advisorModel` in your global `~/.claude/settings.json`?
> (Applies advisor to ALL your projects. Project-level always overrides.)
> `[y/N]`

Default No. If yes, read `~/.claude/settings.json`, add/update only the `advisorModel` key (do NOT touch other keys), write back. This is the only global settings mutation in setup besides Step 7.7's dead plugin cleanup.

**Note:** All pin choices include an advisor that auto-consults at decision points — server-side disabled as of 2026-07-24 pending an Anthropic rollout (not transient; restarting won't fix it). Fall back to a Fable subagent at `xhigh`. Needs CC v2.1.170+ (v2.1.219+ for Opus 5).

### Step 10: Customize Hooks

If `.claude/hooks/` has fewer than 9 files, hooks were never installed — tell the user to run `npx agentic-sdlc-wizard@latest init` first (the wizard doc's hook code blocks are illustrative, not a full template set).

Update `tdd-pretool-check.sh` with the actual source directory (replace generic `/src/` pattern).

### Step 11: Verify Setup

Run verification checks:
1. All generated files exist and are non-empty
2. Hooks are executable (`chmod +x`)
3. `settings.json` is valid JSON
4. Skill frontmatter is correct (name, effort fields)
5. `.gitignore` has required entries (.claude/plans/, .claude/settings.local.json)

Report any issues found.

### Step 12: Instruct Restart and Next Steps

Tell the user:
> Setup complete. Hooks and settings load at session start.
> **Exit Claude Code and restart it** for the new configuration to take effect.
> On restart, the SDLC hook will fire and you'll see the checklist in every response.
>
> **Optional next steps:**
> - Run `/claude-automation-recommender` for stack-specific tooling suggestions (MCP servers, formatting hooks, type-checking hooks, plugins)
> - After a few sessions, run `/less-permission-prompts` — a native Claude Code skill
>   that scans your transcripts for common read-only Bash/MCP calls and proposes a
>   prioritized allowlist. Reduces permission friction without enabling auto mode.
> - Run `/insights` (native CC, v2.1.101+) **monthly** for friction patterns from session history. Output is **qualitative-only** — it does NOT replace token-spike detection (`hooks/token-spike-check.sh`, ROADMAP #220), which needs raw session JSONL.
>
> All three are complementary to the SDLC wizard — they add tooling and quality-of-life, not process enforcement.

## Rules

- NEVER ask what you already know from scanning. If you found it, confirm it — don't ask it.
- NEVER use a fixed question count. The number of questions is dynamic based on scan results.
- ALWAYS show detected values organized by resolution state and let the user confirm or override.
- ALWAYS generate metadata comments in SDLC.md (version, date, steps).
- If most data points are resolved after scanning, present findings for bulk confirmation — don't force individual questions.
- If the user passes `regenerate` as an argument, skip Q&A and regenerate files from existing SDLC.md metadata.
- If the user passes `verify-only` as an argument, skip to Step 11 (verify) only.
