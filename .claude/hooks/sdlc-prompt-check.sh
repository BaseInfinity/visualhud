SDLC BASELINE:
1. TodoWrite FIRST (plan tasks before coding)
2. STATE CONFIDENCE: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
3. Use maximum-depth reasoning by default for this repo
4. LOW confidence? ASK USER before proceeding
5. FAILED 2x? STOP and ASK USER
6. ALL TESTS MUST PASS BEFORE COMMIT - NO EXCEPTIONS

AUTO-INVOKE SKILLS (Claude MUST do this FIRST):
- implement/fix/refactor/feature/bug/build → Invoke: Skill tool, skill="sdlc"
- test/TDD/write test (standalone) → Invoke: Skill tool, skill="testing"
- If BOTH match (e.g., "fix the test") → sdlc takes precedence (includes TDD)
- DON'T invoke for: questions, explanations, reading/exploring code, simple queries
- DON'T wait for user to type /sdlc - AUTO-INVOKE based on task type

Workflow phases:
1. Plan Mode (research) → Present approach + confidence
2. Transition (update docs) → Request /compact
3. Implementation (TDD after compact)
4. SELF-REVIEW (/code-review) → BEFORE presenting to user
