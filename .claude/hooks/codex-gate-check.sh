# Codex review findings (hook-enforcement-436):
# Round 1: extracting the "command" field's value via grep/sed with
# `[^"]*` broke when an earlier quote appeared in the command (e.g. `cd
# "$dir" && git commit ...`) — the class stops at the first literal `"`
# regardless of JSON escaping, truncating the capture before it ever
# reached "git commit" (false negative — review-less commit slipped
# through).
# Round 2: matching "git commit" against the WHOLE raw TOOL_INPUT (the
# round-1 fix) over-corrected — a non-commit command got blocked if any
# OTHER field (e.g. the Bash tool's own "description") happened to mention
# "git commit" in prose (false positive).
# Fix: extract just the "command" field's value with an escape-aware
# pattern — `([^"\\]|\\.)*` consumes an escaped quote (`\"`) as one unit
# instead of treating it as a terminator, so it can't stop early, and it
# still can't run past the field's true (unescaped) closing quote because
# neither alternative in the group can match a bare `"`. Scoped to just
# this field, so unrelated fields containing the phrase can't false-trigger.
# #236(b): under `set -e`, a grep with no match exits 1 and kills the whole
# script with an undefined exit code (a "command" field can be absent, e.g.
# an old-format payload) — `|| true` makes "no match" a clean, deliberate
# empty COMMAND_FIELD instead of a crash.

# value containing a space inside quotes is a real, valid git invocation
# (e.g. `git -c user.name="A B" commit`) but broke the structural match below
# — `\S+` stops at the embedded space, so the flag-value alternative never
# matches and the whole "git ... commit" pattern silently fails, letting the
# commit through unreviewed. Fix: strip COMMAND_FIELD down to just the raw
# value content (COMMAND_VALUE, still JSON-escaped), then collapse every
# quoted sub-span — both JSON-escaped `\"..\"` and plain `'..'` — to a single
# placeholder token before the structural match runs, so a quoted value can
# never look like more than one word to it.
