# PreCompact hook - block manual /compact mid-git-operation
# Fires on manual /compact only (auto-compact is threshold-driven; blocking
# it could push past 100% context and lose everything). Matcher: "manual"
# in .claude/settings.json.
#
# Requires Claude Code v2.1.105+ (PreCompact event introduced April 13, 2026).
#
# #236(b): the original design also blocked on .reviews/handoff.json being
# PENDING_REVIEW/PENDING_RECHECK (mid cross-model-review-round). Removed —
# every real firing on record over ~2.5 months was a false positive (a
# completed rebase's stale REBASE_HEAD, or an abandoned PENDING handoff),
# never a true positive, and ~150 of this file's 256 lines were self-heal
# machinery mitigating that false-positive rate (3 heal paths + dry-run
# scaffolding). The git-op check below has no such record.
#
# Seam policy: compacting mid-git-operation loses evidence the operation
# needs to finish correctly. Block when a rebase/merge/cherry-pick is in
# progress; allow otherwise.

# Token-bloat fix: when both project + plugin register this hook, plugin yields.
# Use parameter expansion (not `dirname`) so the PATH-restricted gh-missing test
# still works — bash builtin `${var%/*}` is always available.
