# Stop hook — warns (non-blocking) when the session is about to end with
# significant uncommitted changes and no REVIEWED/CERTIFIED cross-model
# review artifact.
#
# Gap this closes (Fable self-enforcement audit, #436): a full SDLC workflow
# can complete — Claude presents "done, here's what I changed" — without
# ever running `git commit`. codex-gate-check.sh only fires on that one
# Bash command, so it never triggers and cross-model review is silently
# skippable. This hook catches the "never committed, walked away" case.
#
# Non-blocking by design: Stop fires at the end of every turn, not just at
# true session end, and it must never prevent the user from getting their
# response. Fires once per session (sentinel-gated) to avoid nagging on
# every iterative turn while a feature is still in progress.
