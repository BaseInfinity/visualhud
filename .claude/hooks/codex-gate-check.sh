# Codex review findings (hook-enforcement-436):
# Round 1: extracting the "command" field's value via grep/sed with
# `[^"]*` broke when an earlier quote appeared in the command (e.g. `cd
# "$dir" && git commit ...`) — the class stops at the first literal `"`
# regardless of JSON escaping, truncating the capture before it ever
# reached "git commit" (false negative — review-less commit slipped
# through).
# Round 2: matching "git commit" against the WHOLE raw TOOL_INPUT (the
# round-1 fix) over-corrected — a non-commit command got blocked if any
# OTHER field (e.g. the Bash tool's own "description") happened to mention
# "git commit" in prose (false positive).
# Fix: extract just the "command" field's value with an escape-aware
# pattern — `([^"\\]|\\.)*` consumes an escaped quote (`\"`) as one unit
# instead of treating it as a terminator, so it can't stop early, and it
# still can't run past the field's true (unescaped) closing quote because
# neither alternative in the group can match a bare `"`. Scoped to just
# this field, so unrelated fields containing the phrase can't false-trigger.
