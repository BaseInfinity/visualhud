# SessionStart hook — effort/model nudge.
#
# Behavior (per ROADMAP #217):
#   effort=max    -> silent (preferred default, above floor)
#   effort=xhigh  -> silent (minimum floor on Opus 4.7)
#   effort=high|medium|low (or unset) -> LOUD WARNING:
#     Opus 4.7 needs xhigh floor for SDLC compliance (TDD, self-review, deep reasoning).
#     Recommends `/effort max`. Also reminds about recommended model `opus[1m]`.
#
# CC does not expose the current model to hooks, so the model nudge is emitted as
# guidance for Claude to compare against its own system prompt.
#
# Non-blocking: always exits 0.
